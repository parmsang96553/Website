    <h2>In this game, you get to go through the process of making TWO different types of sushi which are the California Roll and Salmon Roll.
    You go through the process by inputting the ingredients such as seaweed and rice, which you can see on the left-hand side of the text describing the process.
    At the end of your process, you get to cut the sushi, and both types of sushi are displayed on a plate.</h2>
